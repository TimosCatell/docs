# Welcome to TorPlus documentation.

TorPlus is an open-source project that extends [Tor](https://www.torproject.org/download/tor/) with an IPFS [link] caching layer and a Stellar-based [link] monetization layer. You can find more details in the architecture page [link].

To access TorPlus content you can download the official client [here], which will install the TorPlus Extension for Chrome. Alternatively, you can build the client from sources [link].
To participate in the TorPlus network (and earn TorPlus tokens), you can either start a network provider node [link], which provides Tor forwarding and anonymity services and IPFS storage/caching services. Weâ€™ve provided a docker image [link] to simplify setting up a new node.

You can also start a TorPlus web server. You can follow the instructions [here] or take a look at the example sites [links to sites] (you will need the TorPlus client to access those). The source code for these sites is here [links]. You can freely copy and extend those samples.
